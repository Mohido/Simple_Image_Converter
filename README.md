# Simple_Image_Converter
A simple converter that takes an image and convert it to a simple file. This simple program was made to help us implement the picture rendering in the chess engine we are developing with "Concurrent Clean Programming Language."

# How to use:
1) make sure to have the JRE installed on your machine.
2) open any terminal window and just run the jar file with the following command
<code>java -jar img_converter.jar <path> </code>
<br>
3) If you see a successful message on the terminal it means that the file has been converted successfully.


# Example:
  run <code>  java -jar .\img_conv.jar "\images\white_queen.png" </code> to see the cimg text file appears.

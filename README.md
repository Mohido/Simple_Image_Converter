# Simple_Image_Converter
A simple converter that takes an image and convert it to a simple file. This simple program was made to help us implement the picture rendering in the chess engine we are developing with "Concurrent Clean Programming Language."

# How to use:
1) make sure to have the JRE installed on your machine.
2) open any terminal window and just run the jar file with the following command
<code>java -jar img_converter.jar "path" </code>
3) If you see a successful message on the terminal it means that the file has been converted successfully.
4) Make Sure to have the latest JRE installed (Not the default windows version (1.8)).

# Example:
  on windows, run <code>  java -jar .\img_conv.jar "\images\white_queen.png" </code> to see the cimg text file appears. </br>
  or more specificilly: <code>  java -jar .\img_conv.jar [filepath] </code> Note: in windows you should start with "\picture.png" (\) if the picture is in the same directory as the JAR file.
